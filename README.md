# Node_Influence_Based_Label_Propagation
A Node Influence Based Label Propagation Algorithm for Community Detection in Networks

## Description of NIBLPA algorithm

Although this algorithm works like general LPA, there are some differences: <br />
**LPA:** <br />
    - Puts nodes in a list(called X) using a random function. <br />
    - For each node, selects a label which has the most frequency in the node's neighborhood and assigns it as the node's new label. <br />
    - If there are more than one label with the most frequency for a node, LPA chooses one of them randomly. <br />

**NIBLPA:** <br />
    - Sorts the nodes in a vector by their NI value(NI is obtained by KS value) <br />
    - KS definition: It is assigned a k value to each node of the graph. Each node is located in a connected subgraph called k-shell in which each node has a minimum degree of k and can not be in a (k+1)-shell. <br />
    - To calculate k value for each node, NIBLPA begins from KS = 0 and the value is increased one unit level by level. In each level, edges of nodes with maximum degree of KS are removed. Each node's k value equals to the value of KS at a level the node has lost its last edge. This process will continue untill all edges are removed. <br />
    - NIBLPA works just like LPA in assigning labels to nodes but for the condition when there are more than one label with the most frequency for a node, NIBLPA calculates LI value and chooses the label with the most LI value. <br />
    - At last,(in both algorithms) nodes with same labels are located in a unique community. <br />
    
    
## A brief explaination for methods used in the NIBLPA code <br />

    - **Begin:** Assigns a unique label to each node. <br />
    - **findKS:** Calculates the k value for each node and puts them in an array called KS. <br />
    - **findNI:** Calculates the NI value for each node by the formula written in the article. <br />
    (**Notice:** <br />
    N(i) in the formula means the set of nodes which are neighbours to node i. <br />
    d(j) means degree of node j. <br />
    ‚àù is a constant value between 0 and 1 that can be assigned in the begining of code execution by the user. Its value can influence the result!) <br />
    - **Merge & sort:** Implementation of merge-sort algorithm in order to sort vector X <br />
    - **sortX:** Sorts the nodes in decreasing order of their NI value <br />
    - **calculateMaxLI:** For each node of the graph, calculates the LI value by the formula written in the article. <br />
    - **updateLabels:** For the condition when there are more than one label with the most frequency for a node, this method calls calculateMaxLI and chooses the label with the most LI value. <br />
    - **divideCommunity:** At the end of the algorithm when the labels will not change any more, nodes with same label will be located in one community implemented by hashSet.Also, "Result" is a vector of vector variable which is filled in this method and in each vector of it, all the nodes with the same label are gathered together. <br />
    - **detectCommunity:** By calling this method, the whole NIBLPA algorithm will run in order and step by step. <br />
